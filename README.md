# Flask Template

This template project provides a very simple Flask application with pytest configured.

It uses a venv virtual environment. This should be transparent using the Makefile.

You need python3 and make installed.

## Getting Started

1. Configure the venv and install requirements

  ```bash
  make init
  ```

1. Run tests

   ```bash
   make test
   ```

2. Run the dev server

   ```bash
   make deb
   ```
